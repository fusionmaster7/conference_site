      The first Prime Minister of independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru, sought to develop India as a leader in science
      and technology. Between 1959 and 1965, with this vision, the Government founded 14 educational institutions in
      different regions of India. The system of competitive entry (based on merit) gave access to higher education in
      these institutions. Such an institution was established in 1963 in Kurukshetra as a joint enterprise of the
      Government of India and the Government of Punjab, India as the Regional Engineering College, Kurukshetra (REC
      Kurukshetra). In 2002, all the Regional Engineering Colleges were unified by a common entrance exam. Therefore,
      REC Kurukshetra was renamed to National Institute of Technology under the NIT Act and was given a Deemed
      University status.
