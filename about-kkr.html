      Located in the state of Haryana in India, Kurukshetra is a famous pilgrimage site. It is also the land of the
      Bhagvad Gita. Kurukshetra is situated around 170 km north of Delhi and is also known by many names like
      Brahmakshetra (Land of Brahma), Uttaradevi, Brahmadevi and Dharamkshetra (Holy City). The place is known for the
      battle between the Kauravas and Pandavas in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. It is believed that this is the place
      where Krishna recited Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. Gita Jayanti, which falls during the months of November and
      December, commemorates this event of preaching Gita to Arjuna. Sadhus and pilgrims from across the country and
      many foreigners visit Kurukshetra for Gita Jayanti.
      <br /><br />
      Based on the excavations carried out in many parts of Kurukshetra it can be said that this place existed before
      the Harappan civilization. According to ancient records, Kurukshetra was the center of learning and Vedic
      civilization. It is said that the Hindu composition, philosophies and doctrine of the Rig Veda was created in
      Kurukshetra. Francois Bernier, the French traveler, during the reign of Shahjahan had mentioned Kurukshetra’s
      sacred tanks. Abul Fazal, Akbar’s court historian, also mentioned about the tanks of Kurukshetra in Akbarnama.
      <br /><br />
      Kurukshetra was earlier called Thanesar or Sthaneswar. The name Thanesar was derived from the Sanskrit
      ‘Sthaneshwar’, which can be translated to ‘place of god’. Kurukshetra is a place of religious importance and is
      among the oldest cities of the country.

    <div class="about-heading heading text-center">HISTORY OF KURUKSHETRA</div>
    <p class="content about-content text-justify">
      According to another legend, Kurukshetra was named after the King Kuru, who was from the Bahrata Dynasty and was
      the ancestor of Pandavas and Kauravas in Mahabharata. According to Vamana Purana, Thanesar or Kurukshetra was
      selected by King Kuru for incorporating eight virtues, which are brahmacharya, yajna, charity, purity, kindness,
      forgiveness, truth and austerity. Impressed by the work of King Kuru, Vishnu gave him two boons. One of the boons
      was that the land will be named after him as Kurukshetra and it forever will be called Holy Land. The second boon
      was that those who die here will go to heaven. Kurukshetra was also the land, which had two Vedic rivers,
      Drishadvati and Saraswati.
      <br /><br />
      The land had many rulers from any dynasties and empires. This place was called Uttarvedi when King Kuru settled
      here. The place has also been called Dharamkshetra, Brahmavedi and Kurukshetra during different eras. According to
      another legend, this is the place where the universe was created by Brahma. According to the Sanskrit epic
      Mahabharata, the 18-day long battle of Mahabharat was held in Kurukshetra and during this battle, Krishna recited
      Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. The place was at the height of its progress when King Harsha was the ruler. During this
      time Thanesar was visited by Hieun Tsang, the Chinese scholar. According to archaeological findings, Kurukshetra
      was made a learning center for people across the world by the Great King Ashoka.

    <p class="content about-content text-justify">
      According to legends, Brahma created the tank flanked by ghats. It is believed that Brahmasarovar is the cradle of
      civilization. The sarovar’s northern bank has a small shrine dedicated to Shiva and it is said that Brahma himself
      placed the Lingam in the shrine. You will find its mention in the Mahabharata. Duryodhana hid under the water of
      the sarovar on the last day of the battle of Kurukshetra.

    <p class="content about-content text-justify">
      Located on the Kurukshetra-Pehowa Road just 12 km away from Kurukshetra town, Jyotisar is one of the sacred sites
      in India. The word Jyotisar is derived from Jyoti, which means light, and Sar, which means essence. It is believed
      to be the place where the Bhagwad Gita, the most respected scriptures among Hindus, was delivered by Krishna to
      prepare him for the great battle and remove all his doubts. By hearing Gita, Arjuna was able to face great
      warriors like Karna nd Bhishma during the war. It is also the place where the Virat Roop (universal form) of
      Krishna was revealed to Arjuna.

    <p class="content about-content text-justify">
      Located in Narkatari, Bhishma Kund is a large water reservoir dedicated to Bhishma, the Kauravs and Pandavas’
      forefather. This is another place in Kurukshetra that has a connection with the Mahabharata. According to legends,
      this is the place where Bhishma lay on a bed of arrows. He fell on the tenth day of the battle of Mahabharata
      after he and Arjuna engaged in fierce match. Lying on the bed of arrows, Bhishma got thirsty and requested for
      water. Cool water was offered by Kauravas but he refused to drink it. Then, Arjuna shot his arrow, which is called
      Parjanyastra, to pierce the earth. Water gushed out of the earth and quenched Bhishma’s thirst. The site where
      Arjuna shot the arrow is now the Bhishma Kund. It is also known as the Banganga. The ancient stepwell of the
      reservoir has been recently renovated.
